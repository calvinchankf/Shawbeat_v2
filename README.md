## NEW Features
* Navigation Drawer for listing previous pulished press
* Pull to refresh for navigation drawer list
* Viewpager UI for each press category
* Pull to refresh for titles list

## Cautions
* Since Facebook SDK always changes, I haven't import Facebook SDK in this project, thus users cannot share content to facebook. If one wants to implement fb share, please use latest fb SDK in your version.
* Since GCM library is deprecated (google has migrated it to use GCM via google play services), I havn't implement it in this version. If one wants to wants to implement push notification, please use latest push technology.(You know, google API is always changing...XD)
